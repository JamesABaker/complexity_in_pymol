# About

The aim is to roll out [TMSOC](http://tmsoc.bii.a-star.edu.sg/) like function into 3D protein structures. The project has two components. First is a PyMol script for visualising sequence complexity in the 3D structures. Second is a structural database that describes 3D arrangements of membrane protein intramembrane spaces.



Currently, **the software is available for Linux distributions only** since it is dependent on the `decodeanhmm` file underlying [Phobius](http://software.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/request.cgi?project=phobius).

## PyMol

### About

The script uses Phobius to estimate TMH boundaries. TMSOC is then used to assess complexity. The TMH regions are coloured accordingly:

- none-TMH loops = dark blue
- complex TMH = light blue
- twilight TMH = green
- simple TMH = orange

If a region is in red, Phobius identified a TMH, however, TMSOC experienced an error.

### Installation

This software requires Linux, python3, biopython, Phobius, and Pymol.

#### Phobius
For copyright reasons, the Phobius package cannot be distributed alongside this software. To install Phobius, follow [this link](http://software.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/request.cgi?project=phobius) and enter your details. The package will be emailed to you at an academic email address. Extract the files and copy them into the `complexity_in_pymol/pymol/` folder so it looks that the Pymol folder now has these additional files:

```
  pymol/decodeanhmm
  pymol/phobius.model
  pymol/phobius.options
  pymol/phobius.pl
  pymol/README
```

### Running the script

#### Overview

Move the pdb file into the `complexity_in_pymol/pymol/` directory and then run `bash runme.sh` in a terminal from the complexity_in_pymol/pymol/ folder. In Pymol, navigate to the complexity_in_pymol/pymol/ and after loading the structure enter `run bfactors.py` and then `complexb YOURSTRUCTURENAME, start position of strcutre, bfactors_YOURSTRUCTURENAME_SUBCHAIN.txt`.

#### Step by step instructions

1. Move the PDB file you wish to work on into the Pymol directory. For example `cd Downloads/complexity_in_pymol/pymol/1a91.pdb`
2. In a terminal, navigate to the Pymol folder. For example: `cd Downloads/complexity_in_pymol/pymol`
3. In a terminal, run the `runme.sh`. This runs a series of commands in order and manages and logs the various input and output files. For example: `bash runme.sh`.
4. Enter the PDB filename when prompted. If you experience an error during this process, please log it by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/jbkr/complexity_in_pymol/issues/new) on GitHub.
5. Check that the B-factor files were generated, for example, is there a new file called `bfactors_1a91_A.txt`?
5. Load up the Pymol application.
6. Navigate in the application Pymol to the complexity_in_pymol/pymol directory. For example: `cd Downloads/complexity_in_pymol/pymol`
7. In Pymol load the structure. For example: `load 1a91.pdb`
8. In Pymol, load the B-factors script. Use `run bfactors.py`
9. In Pymol run the bfactor function on your desired molecule. For example `complexb 1a91,1, bfactors_1a91_A.txt`. `complexb` is the command. `1a91` is te molecule name in Pymol, `1` means the starting position on that molecule is 1 (this is different for some molecules, be sure to check in the sequence viewer), and `bfactors_1a91_A.txt` is the text file generated by the shell script for that chain.
