#About
This is a development project. The aim is to integrate a TMSOC like function into pymol.

In pymol type `run Path/To/complexity_in_pymol/complexity.py` and hit enter. Then type `complexity` in the pymol terminal. This function will extract and recolour transmembrane helices according to the complexity score of the helix.

#To do
[ ] TM prediction integration.

[ ] Manual TMH location definitions.

[ ] TMSOC integration.
